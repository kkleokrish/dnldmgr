# Download Manager
Download manager written in C that does segmented downloads and is capable of handling HTTP and FTP. 

This code was written when internet speeds were poor and GUI download managers were not my cup of tea. I wrote it with my friend, Ratan, when I was fresh out of college, but, ensured that it worked well and at the same time behaved well. 

Mpatrol (http://mpatrol.sourceforge.net) was used to vet the code for memory leaks. The original code was written on Red Hat Linux in the year 2000. Tested in cygwin and solaris in the last few years. There are now better alternatives like aria2.
